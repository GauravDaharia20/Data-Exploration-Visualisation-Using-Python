# Things That we have done in this project

1. Defining Problem Statement and Analysing basic metrics 

2. Observations on the shape of data, data types of all the attributes, conversion of categorical attributes to 'category' (If required), missing value detection, statistical summary 

3. Non-Graphical Analysis: Value counts and unique attributes 

4. Visual Analysis - Univariate, Bivariate after pre-processing of the data

Note: Pre-processing involves unnesting of the data in columns like Actor, Director, Country

4.1 For continuous variable(s): Distplot, countplot, histogram for univariate analysis 

4.2 For categorical variable(s): Boxplot

4.3 For correlation: Heatmaps, Pairplots

5. Missing Value & Outlier check

6. Insights based on Non-Graphical and Visual Analysis

6.1 Comments on the range of attributes

6.2 Comments on the distribution of the variables and relationship between them

6.3 Comments for each univariate and bivariate plot
